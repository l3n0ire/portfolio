Our goal was to create a platform to help people access essentials such as food and toiletries while reducing their risk of exposure. Our team created a NodeJS web app to connect volunteer couriers and food banks. We utilized MongoDB Atlas to store user data and Mapbox API to generate optimized delivery routes for couriers. The result was an easy-to-use and accessible platform for food banks and volunteer drivers to coordinate deliveries. As lead developer of this project, I’ve gained a lot of experience working on both the frontend and backend of this web app. Through CourierU I was able to strengthen my skills in fullstack development and explore the amazing technologies and APIs in the market.",

The goal of the project was to create a platform for immigrants to share their stories of coming to Canada. Our team created a scalable blog site solution using Gatsby and Netlify CMS. Using the Netlify CMS, the site administrator could upload text and pictures and Gatsby would automatically generate a blog post and update the site. The result was an intuitive platform for users and an easy to use CMS system for non-technical site administrators such as Azhar himself. As lead developer of this project, I’ve gain a lot of experience working with UI/Ux design as well as styling with CSS.

Our goal was to create a chat bot that will send reminders for important deadlines and display our daily tasks. We developed a discord bot using Python and discord.py API. We stored course information and deadlines in the cloud using MongoDB Atlas and hosted the chat bot on Heroku. Using discord as the interface, allowed us to access Manage on all our devices, as well as the ably to receive push notification directly to out phones. The result was an easy to use, cross platform notification system which my teammate and I still use to keep track of our deadlines to date. Through ManageU I was able to learn asynchronous programming in python and gain experience managing a NoSQL database like MongoDB. This project is particularly significant to me since I was able to build a piece of software to solve a problem I faced in my daily life.",
