                Weâ€™re a group with a strong passion for making projects that end with the letter U. Winning team works on a series of random
                projects which will hopefully let us win some hackatons. Our goal is to explore new tools and technologies with
                the hope of creating something that will statisfy our boredom and something to put on our resumes. Winning team's mission
                is to win a hackaton, but more importantly we strive to build software that benifits the lives of other and that aligns with
                the interest of all team members
